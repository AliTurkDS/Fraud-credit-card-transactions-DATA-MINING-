🕵️‍♂️ Fraud Credit Card Detection

🔍 Overview

A data mining project aimed at detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning. The main challenge was handling imbalanced data, where genuine transactions heavily outnumber fraud cases.

⚙️ Workflow

EDA: Visualized data imbalance and transaction patterns.

Preprocessing: Scaled Time and Amount using PowerTransformer.

Modeling: Trained Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting models.

Balancing: Applied undersampling and oversampling techniques.

Evaluation: Compared models using accuracy, recall, and ROC-AUC.

📈 Results

Best Model: Random Forest

Accuracy: 94%

Recall (Fraud): 78%

AUC: 0.96

🧠 Key Insight

Handling imbalanced datasets properly (through resampling and robust models) greatly improves fraud detection performance.

🛠️ Tools

Python • Pandas • NumPy • Scikit-learn • Matplotlib • Seaborn
